# Introduction

We're at the end of the year! Happy New Year 2025!

This year has been huge for me; it's my first year of working full-time. I had a lot of new experiences. Here's how it went!

# Bought a MacBook with my own money

Believe it or not, this is my first MacBook bought with my own money. I got my last one for free from Apple Academy ðŸ¤£.

Though I can't say it isn't expensive, I feel this purchase is well justified since it has brought me thousands of percent in returns as it supports my work.

This one is a 14" MacBook Pro M3 Pro, with 36GB RAM and 1TB storage. You can never go wrong with more RAM; I don't regret spending extra hundreds for just the extra RAM. I don't want to see the 'out of application memory' popup ðŸ’€

I remember I was considering whether to get this or a Mac Studio. I already have all of the peripherals set up at homeâ€”monitor, mouse, keyboard, speaker. Getting a Mac Studio is much cheaper than a MacBook. I could even save more if I got a Mac Mini.

But I think getting a MacBook is the correct decision for me. It turns out I love traveling. Having a portable and strong machine is what I need.

# Business Trip to Dubai

This year was also my first time having a business trip. We had an off-site in Dubai! This marked my first time leaving the Asian continent ðŸ”¥

Hands down, the cityscape of Dubai is one of the most beautiful I've seen so far! I also visited the Burj; it was really beautiful seeing all of the buildings at night.

## Thoughts about Dubai

Dubai is beautiful, but it doesn't feel like home to me. I don't really like the food, and everything is far from one another. Usually, moving from one place to another spans around 20-30 km, even though the taxis there drive like Fast & Furiousâ€”minimum 120 kph.

Aside from the 0% income tax, I don't think it's the right place for me.
